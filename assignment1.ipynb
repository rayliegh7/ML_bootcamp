    "1) One of  the python feature is python is dynamically type  language means we don’t need to define data types of variable its determine when we assign any variable .\n",
    "2) as similar to other programing language python contain  data types like number ,string, sequence and so. Python numeric data types store numeric values. Number objects are created when you assign a value to them , where python numeric  data types further classified into three sub category as integer , float, complex . \n",
    "3) when any variable contain  whole number like 1 to n then data type of that variable will be integer .if variable contain float or decimal value then data types of that variable will be float . if variable contain expression of complex number (a +bi) where i is iota  in python instead of i we used j for example 3+j\n",
    "4) if we want to assign character or letter or word then we just assign value to variable but enclosed by double quote or single quote but in python don’t support character data type for declare character for example a=’H’ or a=”h”\n",
    "5)   Sequence is the ordered collection of similar or different data types means they are  iterable (we can access each and every element using for loop ,while loop and  we can also perform slicing, for slicing we use index number that ranges from  0 to n that known as positive indexing or forward indexing  if we  want  perform negative index then we used index number from n to 0.\n",
    "6) list is collection of object with  similar or different  data type which is enclosed by []  and each element  is seprated by , ,basically un python list can be consider s a array syntax for list decleartion is: l=[1,2,’hello’,8,]\n",
